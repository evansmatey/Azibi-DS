Challenge Problem statement:
Nana recently started a consulting business where he is paid based on the number of hours and minutes he works on client projects.
He needs a time tracking program, where he enters the date and the time he started working on a task, and then the date and time when he finished a particular task.

The program calculates the hours he spent on a task. It then calculates the amount of money Nana made tackling the task. Note that: Nana is paid $5 dollars per hour.

How the task was solved:? the problem was broken down into two part, the work time and wage calculation and the saving of the details we created two functions to solve this task'

Kolade Gideon was responsible for the "time_tracker" function, he had to make sure the function was compactable with the one been created by Evans, he tried to break down 
every steps for eazy explanation to anyone. The code works well and it was a success.

Evans was responsible for the "save_time_tracker_details" function, this function was created in other clean and save the data generated from the "time tracker" function,
so the basic functionality of this function is to save the details generated for the other function into either a csv or excel file, using pandas.
